This is a personal experimental extension that replaces the standard Google Chrome "New tab" with these annoying
search bar and last visited pages table which you can't disable in the browser settings.

With the "Clean Tab" extension you get absolutely clean and fast loaded new tab with the background image you
specify manually on the extension "Settings" page.

Nota bene:
1. Due to security restrictions it's not possible to load "chrome://theme/IDR_THEME_NTP_BACKGROUND" as a wallpaper.
You need to save your theme wallpaper manually and then specify it via "Choose File" button.
2. Do not expect sweetly decorated settings page or anything else in addition. My goal was just to replace
the standard new tab page so I didn't bother with a "nice and smooth user friendly interface".
3. You can freely edit this extension and make your own analogue with better functionality.
I'll be only pleased if you send me a link to your better extension.
