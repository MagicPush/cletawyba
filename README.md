This is an experimental extension that replaces the standard Google Chrome "New tab" with these annoying search bar and last visited pages table which you can't disable in the browser settings.

With the "Clean Tab" extension you get absolutely clean and fast loaded new tab with the background image you specify manually on the extension "Settings" page.

Important: don't forget to check "Allow access to file URLs" in order to load background image from the filepath you've specified on the "Settings" page.

Nota bene:
1. Due to some techincal reasons (only for now I hope) this version can't load "chrome://theme/IDR_THEME_NTP_BACKGROUND" url to set the background image automatically. That's why you need to specify your background image manually.
2. Do not expect sweetly decorated settings page or anything else in addition. My goal was just to replace the standard new tab page so I didn't bother with a "nice and smooth user friendly interface". Just the functionality I needed to solve my problem.
3. You can freely edit this extension and make your own analogue with better functionality. I'll be only pleased if you send me a link to your better extension.

======

In future versions (main ideas):
1. Correct checks if the extension is able to store your settings (chrome restrictions).
2. Localization (russian).
3. Maybe, an option for theme background (chrome://theme/IDR_THEME_NTP_BACKGROUND) autoload.
